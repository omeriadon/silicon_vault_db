    "description" : "watchOS 11, introduced significant health, fitness, and personalization enhancements for Apple Watch users. The new Vitals app consolidates overnight health metrics—such as heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, blood oxygen, and sleep duration—into a single view, highlighting deviations from typical ranges and notifying users when multiple metrics are outside their norm. The Workout app now estimates effort levels for cardio activities like running and swimming, categorizing them into Easy, Moderate, Hard, or All Out, and allows users to adjust these ratings based on perceived exertion. Custom Workouts have been expanded with features like the Up Next view, displaying remaining intervals and upcoming segments. Users can now pause Activity rings for rest periods without affecting award streaks and set daily goals for each day of the week. The Smart Stack has been enhanced to suggest widgets based on time, location, and routines, and includes support for Live Activities. New watch faces, such as Flux and Reflections, offer dynamic visualizations, and the Photos face intelligently curates images from the user's library. Additional features include sleep apnea notifications, offline translation in the Translate app, and the ability to send money using Tap to Cash.",
